                    At the 2019 Cricket World Cup South Africa lost the opening match of the tournament to England and followed this up with losses to Bangladesh and India. Rained out against West Indies, they d efeated Afghanistan but then lost to New Zealand and Pakistan,
                    to end their chances o qualifying for the next stage. </p>

                    They also hold the record of the highest successful run chase and made the hi ghest total (the latter record has been surpassed) in One-Day Internationals (438â€“9 in 49.5 overs) , in an iconic match against Australia on 12 March 2006. This game is considered
                    by many to be the great est One-Day International ever played.
